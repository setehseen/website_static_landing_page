TechTrend Landing Page

What’s Inside?

The TechTrend Landing Page is a super cool webpage for a fake store called "TechTrend." It has six awesome parts:

Navigation Bar: 
A sticky blue bar with a logo and links (Home, Features, Products, etc.). On phones, it slides out as a menu (☰).

Hero Carousel: 
A slideshow with 5 tech images that switch every 5 seconds. Click arrows or dots to change slides. Has a pulsing “Shop Now” button.

Features Section: 
4 cards that flip when you hover to show why TechTrend rocks (Quality, Shipping, Support, Deals).

Products Section: 
8 cards (Smart Watch, Headphones, etc.) that zoom in when you scroll. Hover to zoom images or lift buttons. Fixed for smooth animations and layout.

Testimonials Section: 
3 customer reviews that fade every 5 seconds. Use arrows or dots to navigate.
Footer: Contact info, links, a newsletter form, and social icons that grow on hover.

File
index.html: One file with all the code.
HTML: Builds the page’s structure.
CSS: Makes it pretty with colors (blue #2c3e50, gold #f1c40f), animations, and grids.
JS: Adds fun interactivity like menu toggles, carousel slides, and product animations.
